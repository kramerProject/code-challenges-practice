-- Table: Logs
--
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | id          | int     |
-- | num         | varchar |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
-- id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
--
--
-- Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
--
-- Return the result table in any order.
--
-- The result format is in the following example.
--
--
--
-- Example 1:
--
-- Input:
-- Logs table:
-- +----+-----+
-- | id | num |
-- +----+-----+
-- | 1  | 1   |
-- | 2  | 1   |
-- | 3  | 1   |
-- | 4  | 2   |
-- | 5  | 1   |
-- | 6  | 2   |
-- | 7  | 2   |
-- +----+-----+
-- Output:
-- +-----------------+
-- | ConsecutiveNums |
-- +-----------------+
-- | 1               |
-- +-----------------+
-- Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums
from logs l1
where num = (select num from logs l2 where l2.id = l1.id + 1)
  and num = (select num from logs l2 where l2.id = l1.id + 2);

-- better solution
select distinct(num) as ConsecutiveNums
from (select num,
             LAG(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS previous_num, LEAD(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next_num
      from logs) t
where t.num = t.previous_num
  and t.num = t.next_num;
